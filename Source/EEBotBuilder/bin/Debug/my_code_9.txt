# NOTE: You can use ?ask as a parameter to ask for user input.
# ?askyes will ask for yes/no. The value is always returned as either yes or no.
# You can also use var:[name]:[value]! [name]:[value]:[code] for only IF value.
# For tutorials on how to use this application, check the github!

# IMPORTANT: ?ask and ?askyes won't work in Debug mode from here. 
# They must be ran directly from the bot.

# example: botemail mybot ?ask

# My first bot!
log Hello world!
log Connecting bot!
bot test
botemail test guest
botpass test guest
botlogin test
botworld test PWRq1VbIEDbkI
botjoin test

# Using botfunction [name]! will call that function.
# Let's say you have botfunction testx{
#log test
#}
# If you do botfunction testx! the result would be 'test' in output!
